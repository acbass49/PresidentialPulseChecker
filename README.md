# Presidential Pulse Checker
election model/simulation based off of latest polls

Predict_Election.R - File containing data cleaning, programming of simulation, and methodology

electoral_votes_by_state.csv - Electoral College vote data by state

states_list.csv - List of States for easy conversion

I also use 538 polls and model data and map data using usmap package that I load directly in the .R file
