# Presidential Pulse Checker
election model/simulation based off of latest polls

statevotes.csv - Electoral College vote data by state
stateslist.csv - List of States for easy conversion
region.csv - States linked to geographic regions
Predict_Election.R - File containing data cleaning, programming of simulation, and methodology

I also use 538 polls and model data and map data using usmap package that I load directly in the .R file
